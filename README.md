A simple Shinylive app that highlights R packages on CRAN that are currently nearing their issue-response deadlines, according to `tools::CRAN_package_db()`. 

The app is available on the web but computations run in your browser: [matt-dray.github.io/cran-deadlines](https://matt-dray.github.io/cran-deadlines)

Built primarily with [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/r/getstarted/shiny-basics/lesson1/index.html), [{bslib}](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/), and [{shinylive}](https://posit-dev.github.io/r-shinylive/).
